# Deal Claiming Success Message Fix

## Problem
When users clicked "Claim Deal" on the subscription page, they were not seeing a success message confirming that their deal was activated and their subscription was successful.

## Root Cause
The deal claiming flow was redirecting users to the general `/success` page instead of back to the subscription page where the success banner is displayed. This meant:
1. Users lost context about the deal they claimed
2. No specific messaging about the deal being applied
3. The success experience was generic rather than deal-specific

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `redirectToCheckout` Method
- Added `isDeal` parameter to distinguish between regular subscriptions and deal claims
- Updated success URL routing:
  - **Regular subscriptions**: → `/success` (dedicated success page)
  - **Deal claims**: → `/subscribe?subscription=success&plan=X&coupon=Y&deal=true` (back to subscription page with success banner)

### 2. Updated Mock Checkout Flow
- Enhanced mock checkout to handle deal-specific redirects
- Preserved deal context through the entire checkout process
- Updated method signatures to support the `isDeal` flag

### 3. Enhanced Success Banner
- **Deal-specific messaging**: "Deal Claimed Successfully!" vs "Subscription Activated!"
- **Coupon display**: Shows applied coupon code and discount information
- **Context-aware content**: Different messaging for deals vs regular subscriptions
- **Action buttons**: Enhanced CTAs for deal claimers ("Start Trading Now")

### 4. URL Parameter Handling
- Captures `plan`, `coupon`, and `deal=true` parameters from URL
- Preserves deal context throughout the success flow
- Automatically cleans up URL parameters after processing
